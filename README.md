## Run the app locally
Create a `.env.local` file with the unsplash access token
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY={YOUR_TOKEN_HERE}
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Notes
### Did not get to the following
- Integration testing
- URL param validation
- Many edge cases around error handling, loading states
- Performance optimizations
- Accessibility
- and more...

I realized afterward that I should have asked whether I should prioritize completing all the features or completing a few features well with the allotted time. I optimized for completing all features instead of not completing all the features but completing them well.
